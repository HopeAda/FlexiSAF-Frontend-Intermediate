TASK 1:
I chose to build a Student Grade Management App because it aligns well with the learning outcomes of the lesson on Advanced JavaScript. The project allowed me to apply ES6 features such as let and const for variable declarations and arrow functions for cleaner code. I also worked extensively with array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach, and splice) to implement core functionality like calculating averages, filtering passing students, and removing or updating student records.

In addition, I used objects to store student details ({ name, score }), which reflects real-world data structures. This project directly fulfilled the deliverable expectations, as I implemented the required JavaScript concepts in a practical application and hosted it on a free platform, making it accessible through a live link. By presenting the working app and linking it back to the learning objectives, I demonstrated both understanding and practical application of the weekâ€™s curriculum.



TASK 2:
I added styles to the entire page, and added additional html elements like the add button to add new students. I converted the form to a modal that opens when the add button is clicked.
I added a modal for confirming deletion of items in the list.
I added a default template array for the site to allow all functionalities to be seen easily
Added local storage to allow for persistence of data
Added a button to clear the list


TASK 3:
I created a simple portfolio page, and styled it with the sass/scss preprocessor

TASK 4: 
I created a folder focused on git, and I practised the git commands with image proof placed in the markdown file in my task4 folder
