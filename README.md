TASK 1:
I chose to build a Student Grade Management App because it aligns well with the learning outcomes of the lesson on Advanced JavaScript. The project allowed me to apply ES6 features such as let and const for variable declarations and arrow functions for cleaner code. I also worked extensively with array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach, and splice) to implement core functionality like calculating averages, filtering passing students, and removing or updating student records.

In addition, I used objects to store student details ({ name, score }), which reflects real-world data structures. This project directly fulfilled the deliverable expectations, as I implemented the required JavaScript concepts in a practical application and hosted it on a free platform, making it accessible through a live link. By presenting the working app and linking it back to the learning objectives, I demonstrated both understanding and practical application of the weekâ€™s curriculum.
